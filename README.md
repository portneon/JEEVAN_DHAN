Shashwat Sharma 

## 3. Problem Statement
In India, people often misplace or lose their medical reports, prescriptions, and test results, leading to repeated tests, increased costs, and treatment delays.  
There is also no centralized system for patients to carry their medical history securely and accessibly across different hospitals.  
This project aims to provide a secure, easy-to-use mobile platform where users can store, organize, and access their medical records anytime.

## 4. Proposed Solution / Idea
Jeevan Dhan will be a mobile application where users can securely upload, store, and categorize their medical records in digital format.  
The app will allow users to access their health data anywhere, share it with doctors securely, and maintain a complete medical history in one place.  
The system will focus on security, ease of use, and offline accessibility.

## 5. Key Features
- Secure cloud storage for medical reports, prescriptions, and bills
- OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract and organize report details
- Categorization by type (X-ray, blood test, prescription, etc.)
- Emergency access mode for doctors (with user consent)
- Offline access to previously stored records
- User authentication & encryption for data protection

## 6. Target Users / Audience
- General public (patients)
- Elderly individuals with multiple ongoing treatments
- People with chronic illnesses who need frequent access to medical history

## 7. Technology Stack
- **Frontend (Mobile App):** React Native, NativeWind / Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express or Firebase
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas / Firebase Firestore
- **Storage:** AWS S3 / Firebase Storage
- **OCR Integration:** Tesseract.js or Google Cloud Vision API
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth or JWT-based system

## 8. Expected Outcome
A functional mobile application that enables users to upload, store, categorize, and share their medical records securely,  
with an easy-to-use interface and offline accessibility.

## 9. Timeline
